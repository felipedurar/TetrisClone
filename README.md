# TetrisClone
A Tetris Game coded using C++

# What is it
This is a Tetris game that i coded when i was 14 years old, the code is not that great but i want keep it here to keep history of the coded i've done.
There is a lot of logic that can be optimized on this code, such as the image loading process, better structure, use of trigonometry for the matrix rotation and others.

# How to run it
This was coded using C++ and compiled using the MinGW on Windows, the game uses the SDL for graphics, window, audio and text, so in order to run this game you should set up the following libraries:

- SDL
- SDL_image
- SDL_mixer
- SDL_ttf

Please ensure all the resource files are relative to the executable file.

# Why i coded it?
I have a Youtube Channel and i use to post some programming videos since 2013 on the main channel and i also posted some others before but those were deleted, but basically
i was recording my screen while i was coding this game and one of the ideas was to code as fast as possible trying to solve the problems as i could (even if workarounds were needed), so thats another reason why this code isn't good.

# Bugs and bad optimization
As i said above, this code isn't optimized, is buggy and is not a great ideia to use as an example for game creation, maybe in the future i gonna make a good version of it and i goona put a link here in this readme redirecting to the repo.
